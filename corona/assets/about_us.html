This is a game/simulator for Conway's Game of Life,
for an excellent overview of that game, see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia's entry</a>
for it.
<p>
Essentially, each cell in the grid can be either "alive" or "dead", and
a given cell's 8 nearest neighbors determine if it lives or dies.
Specifically (quoting Wikipedia): 
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
</ul>
<p>
You can interact with the simulation by simply dragging your finger across
the screen.  All the cells you touch will become "live" in the next time-step.
Of course, if you put too many of them together, then they will quickly die out.
<p>
There is a "Pause" button on the screen if you want to stop the simulator
and "hand-code" a group of live cells all at once.
<p>
Use the "Settings" screen to change the grid size and cell color, as well
as speed-up or slow-down the simulation.  There is also a setting to set
the initial density of "live" cells (you can set to 0 if you want to start
with a blank screen).
